## Bonjour!

<div style="text-align: justify">
My name is Achille, I am French, and throughout my career, I have been committed to developing interpretable AI solutions for real-world problems.
Precisely, I aim to build tools that are directly <strong>applicable</strong> by domain experts, tailored to their practical needs. 
In particular, I believe that meaningful innovation emerges from <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> collaboration. 
New discoveries and ideas hide in the interstices between expert communities and bridging them is essential!
Finally, <strong>interpretable AI</strong> is essential for breaking down technical silos and empowering users with understanding and trust.
