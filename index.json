Indeed, they allow to share worldwide a huge amount of information. Networks are however complex systems, both in size and technological diversity. Therefore, it makes their management and repair more difficult. In order to limit the negative impact of such failures, some tools have to be developed to detect a failure as soons as it occurs, analyse its root causes to solve it efficiently, or even predict this failure to prevent it rather than cure it. In this thesis, we mainly focus on these last two problems. To do so, we use files, called alarm logs, storing all the alarms issued by the system. However, these files are generally noisy and verbose: an operator managing a network needs tools able to extract and handle in an interpretable manner the causal relationships within a log. First, we build online a structure, called DIG-DAG, that stores all the potential causal relationships involving the events of a log. We then propose a query system to exploit this structure. Finally, we apply this approach in the context of root cause analysis. Second, we discuss a generative approach for times series prediction. In particular, we compare two well-known models for this task: recurrent neural nets on the one hand, hidden Markov models on the other hand. Indeed, in their respective communities, these two models are state of the art. Here, we compare analytically their expressivity by encompassing them into a probabilistic model, called GUM.","tags":["Machine learning","Networks","Alarm prediction","Pattern matching","Hidden Markov Models","Recurrent Neural Networks"],"title":"Alarm prediction in networks via space-time pattern matching and machine learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Veggie is Python framework allowing to manipulates tries, automaton and more generally data structure used in language theory.

To enhance reliability of their networks, operators require tools to quickly understand the cause of an outage. In particular, logs of alarms keep track of failures arising in their infrastructures. Due to the increasing size of networks and to the high diversity of technologies, these files may be verbose and noisy. That is why analyzing a log is often complex, hence delaying recovery and then degrading network availability. This demo presents a tool suite dedicated to log analysis. Our methodology is illustrated through the processing of a real alarm log issued from a 4G network. First, one can simplify the log by discarding irrelevant alarms and by clustering co-occurrent ones. Then, the underlying graph structure, called DIG-DAG, can store causal patterns by processing the input log online. Hence, experts can query the DIG-DAG to retrieve small and interpretable patterns.","tags":["Online algorithm","Pattern matching","Fault diagnosis"],"title":"Demo abstract: end-to-end root cause analysis of a mobile network","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"7f49c6151261ea3e207d6f37bd3a41ea","permalink":"https://achillesalaun.github.io/project/pybgl/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/pybgl/","section":"project","summary":" A pure python graph library inspired from the BGL (Boost Graph Library).\nPybgl is used by Veggie.

Although both models have been extended in several ways (eg. Long Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit architec-tures, Variational RNN, partially observed Markov models.. .), their theoretical understanding remains partially open. In this context, our approach consists in classifying both models from an information geometry point of view. More precisely, both models can be used for modeling the distribution of a sequence of random observations from a set of latent variables; however, in RNN, the latent variable is deterministically deduced from the current observation and the previous latent variable, while, in HMM, the set of (random) latent variables is a Markov chain. In this paper, we first embed these two generative models into a generative unified model (GUM). We next consider the subclass of GUM models which yield a stationary Gaussian observations probability distribution function (pdf). Such pdf are characterized by their covariance sequence; we show that the GUM model can produce any stationary Gaussian distribution with geometrical covariance structure. We finally discuss about the modeling power of the HMM and RNN submodels, via their associated observations pdf: some observations pdf can be modeled by a RNN, but not by an HMM, and vice versa; some can be produced by both structures, up to a re-parameterization.","tags":["Hidden Markov Models","Recurrent Neural Networks"],"title":"Comparing the modeling powers of RNN and HMM","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Achille Salaün","Anne Bouillard","Marc-Olivier Buob"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575417600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575417600,"objectID":"a5c3e7afa63b7da4d3de207fb2b22f11","permalink":"https://achillesalaun.github.io/publication/2019_mln/","publishdate":"2019-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_mln/","section":"publication","summary":"Increasing size and complexity of telecommunication networks make troubleshooting and network management more and more critical.
